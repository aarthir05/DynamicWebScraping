# Courses Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This project involves scraping course information from TalentEdge's browse courses page. The spider extracts details about various courses, including course names, specifications, descriptions, and payment information. The data is collected using Scrapy with Splash to handle dynamic content.

## Project Structure

- `spiders/courses.py`: The Scrapy spider that performs the web scraping.
- `scraped_courses4.csv`: The output CSV file where scraped data is saved.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python packages.
